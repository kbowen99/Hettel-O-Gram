# Hettel-O-Gram
 The Hettel-O-Gram is a 3D hologram projector for Hettel. The projector uses the same principles as phone based hologram projectors ([like this](http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a16713/diy-hologram-prism-for-phone/)) on a larger scale. The goal for the Hologram Projector is to be able to visualize large CAD Models and designs in a way that is more intuitive.
